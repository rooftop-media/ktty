kTTY is JS tools for making nice UIs in <a href="#text-terminals">text terminals</a>.  

kTTY's functionality is captured in 📄 `/ktty/ktty.js`,  which bundles: 
 - the <a href="https://github.com/rooftop-media/ktty/tree/main/Ribbon">Ribbon Functions</a> ( 🗂 `/ktty/Ribbon/*`), and also 
 - the <a href="https://github.com/rooftop-media/ktty/tree/main/Browser">Browser Functions</a> ( 🗂 `/ktty/Browser/*` ). 

There's also a file for a series of tests, 📄 `/ktty/tests`,
which doubles as a sort of educational demo of the stack. 

<br /><br />

<h4> 🐯  - How to use...</h4>

<h4> 🐯  - About the name...</h4>

TTY stands for TeleTYpe, referring to [teletype terminals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teletype_Model_33).  

kTTY is best described as "KitchenWare's Terminal Tools", 
even though the acronym doesn't quite match.
